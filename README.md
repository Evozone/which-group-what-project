While there are lots of commerical solutions for managing teams and project in an organization, there are very few open-source solutions that even a school or college can use. This project aims to provide a simple CRUD web application that can be used to manage projects and groups. The project is built using Streamlit and Supabase.

## ü§î Who can use it?

Currently, the project is in development and is not ready for production use. However, once the project is complete, it is developed specifically for my college, [Pillai College of Engineering](https://www.pce.ac.in/), for the Computer Engineering Department.

However, since the project is open-source, you can use it for your college or school as well. You can also use it for your organization by making some changes to the code.

### ‚Üù Pre-requisites
   - You have a [Google Account created by your Workplace or School](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_in/)
   - You have a database of the teachers and students in your college.
